  abstract={In this article, I address our understanding of the word gap, or why parents’ talk to children differs by socioeconomic status. The differences in quantity and quality of parents’ input across early childhood predict children's language development and their readiness for school. As a result, a growing number of interventions target parent–child interactions to enhance children's early experiences and promote learning. Understanding the factors that shape parents’ communication with their children is essential and has implications for empirical research as well as interventions to reduce early disparities in children's language development.}

  year={2012},

  abstract={Quantity and quality of caregiver input was examined longitudinally in a sample of 50 parent–child dyads to determine which aspects of input contribute most to children’s vocabulary skill across early development. Measures of input gleaned from parent–child interactions at child ages 18, 30, and 42 months were examined in relation to children’s vocabulary skill on a standardized measure 1 year later (e.g., 30, 42, and 54 months). Results show that controlling for socioeconomic status, input quantity, and children’s previous vocabulary skill; using a diverse and sophisticated vocabulary with toddlers; and using decontextualized language (e.g., narrative) with preschoolers explains additional variation in later vocabulary ability. The differential effects of various aspects of the communicative environment at several points in early vocabulary development are discussed.}
