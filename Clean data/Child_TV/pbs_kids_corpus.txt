bababababored theres nothing to do around here uh i know it so boring the dreary time is here for me a well titans i know youre bored so am i but if we band together in defiance of the tyranny of boredom ahh your inspirational speech is super boring do you mind im trying to read sorry why dont you try reading a book what is so special about the book well starfire book are a world of imagination they create picture in your mind come on youre just sitting there looking at word words can take you on an imagination adventure you know ive heard tell of this but you know ive never seen it in action id like to go on an imagination adventure  can we uh see one  sure the return of the invisible man my imagination is going into overdrive biography of benjamin franklin this is so amazing the adventure of pinocchio this is so magical the birdwatchers guide to pelican my brain ha never been so alive reading is fundamental yo geppetto held pinocchios hand and showed him how to put one foot after the other  oh huh oh how interesting invisible man you are the coolest books are the best thing ever why did i not try the reading before the world of imagination is awesome if only we could take our love of reading to a new level well ive always wanted to start a book club they have club for book  i want to be a member  me too me number after two so uh how is this supposed to work raven well book club share comment about the book theyve read i loved my book the pelican are funny they give me the splinknards my book wa crazy fun it wa filled with so much adventure my book had science and science is cool guys it more than just sharing feeling it about sharing thought  whats a thought  uh let me show you i found my book premise to be unconvincing the plot twist trite and the philosophical underpinning a strained attempt at significance what did you just do rave i think she just took the fun out of reading quick beast boy tell u about your book i love my book so much i wrote a song about it my book ha a front and a back with paper in the middle got a lot of word in it some are big some are little with number on each page you cant get lost so when i crack my book open man i read like a bos i love the feel of the paper the smell of the ink it challenge my brain muscle man it making me think it my book baby there aint no other like it it my book baby what wait rave  what  we uh we finished reading all of our book  and  we need new book to read why dont you just read each others book you are a nasty girl that is just gross i dont know what to tell you our eye are hungry for the letter arranged in punctuated pattern that convey meaning dont you understand girl we got the need the need to read you gotta get u more book man you cant start u reading and then cut u off reading is fundamental get it together oh this is bad this is real bad i can feel my imagination dying it hurt there must be more book around here somewhere lets split up titans go no book in here no book under the couch whats up fella listen listen i have found one wait thats a comic book is not a comic book a type of book it doesnt count if it ha picture ahh this could never feed our imagination i think i hear a book in here man i am having some serious dã©javu right now nothing i smell a book bingo oh who is the good boy who is the good boy you sure there a book in there only one way to find out look it got a face ooh i love face oh joy it is smiling at me lets read it you guy found another book uh huh uh huh and it ha a face not that book you cant read that one we have to its gonna fuel our imagination but not in a good way that book evil thats why i buried it  too late  ooh aah i told you not to open it its unleashing all the thing youve imagined  well how do we stop it  you have to turn off your imagination i cant do it why did the biography of benjamin franklin have to be so compelling you made reading too much fun raven there ha to be a way of making book boring what might turn our imagination off again thats it we have to take the fun out of reading whos going first um the premise that a man might become invisible is like totally farfetched and resists even the most strenuous suspension of disbelief bro while the biography go over some welltrodden ground ultimately it reminds u why franklin is one of our most fascinating founding father were doing it were making reading boring keep it up guy the author understanding of the ancient egyptians association of pelican with death and the afterlife seem tenuous to say the least the climactic appearance of the blue fairy and her subsequent humanization of the little wooden boy serve to symbolically demonstrate the overcoming of lesser impulse in order to discover one real self its over im gonna destroy this book so it can never hurt anyone again you should have warned u reading isnt just fundamental it dangerous we almost died because of book rave i hope this doesnt do anything to

heat oh no yaah what is wrong with me purity purity tsk back then these snake were born into an environment with very large mammal so the diamondback that developed a rattle had a big advantage over those that didnt they didnt get stepped on you mean suddenly out of nowhere a baby snake wa born with a big rattle the prevailing theory is that it would have been born with an incipient primitive thank you ryan rattlelike mutation that would have developed over thousand of year of evolution but we dont know for sure got that right its also possible that it happened exactly a you said and that one day a baby diamondback wa born with a fully formed mutation that just happened to be extremely beneficial to it survival does this seem irrelevant to all of you because it not now i know a lot of

brains phase one im gonna cover the city with a layer of wax phase two im gonna turn everything underneath the wax into cheese the henchman hold up the plan images showing the city covered in wax paper and cheese flash on the screen word girl gasp kid math asks but why dont you turn the city into cheese first then put the wax over the cheese word girl say hey kid math can i get you to focus on

welcome back the episode open with chalk drawing of word girl and super huggy narrator continues to refresh your memory theres a new superhero in town known as kid math kid math and word girl teamed up to stop dr twobrainss plan to cover the city in wax before turning everything into cheese an image show an equation on the chalkboard it show kid math plus word girl and super huggy plus dr twobrains equal kid math word girl and super hugger in a cage narrator continues and as we ended the previous episode both of our heroes were trapped music plays the image change to word girl and super hugger trapped in a cage kid math hovers outside and say i can get back inside if you think itll help build suspense word girl sigh no forget it super huggy climb on her back a moment later she

that weather update maria in other news the wax fall on top of him the tv reporter say im covered in wax chuck and rachel back to you music plays a moment later the hero are talking flying above the city kid math say we did it we stopped phase one of dr twobrainss evil plan according to my calculations that leaves one more phase to stop come on lets find that mouse blimp word girl say i appreciate your enthusiasm but we wont find dr twobrains until he wants to be found so right now i have to go home for dinner super huggy shriek kid math asks dinner what kind of superhero gives up for dinner word girl answer im not giving up part of being a superhero is balancing your normal life with your superhero duties kid math say normally im all about a balanced equation but it still seems like it would be much easier to just be a superhero all the time word girl say but if everyone knew my secret identity id never eat in peace again because the villains would never leave me alone go back to your spaceship tomorrow at school well talk about the best way to stop dr twobrains kid math say okay ill see you at school tomorrow where thanks to you no one will ever figure out he fly away shouting rex is really kid math word girl say i think hes getting the hang of it huggy shriek word girl sigh and say yeah not at all the next day rex enters the school he turn to a girl wearing a purple shirt and long hair in a purple pony tail and say hello there earth kids im sure not kid math at all the girl say please dont talk to me she close her locker and walk away rex follows and say boy isnt it crazy that neither one of us is a superhero from the planet hexagon i mean what are the odds the girl asks are you following me becky appears and hiss what are you doing rex say making sure no one thinks im he jump into the air and shout kid math student gasp becky say rex telling everyone that youre not kid math is almost equal to saying that you are kid math look just dont talk about kid math at all ever dont even give any hints that you know anything about kid math at all rex asks what do you mean hints becky explains oh a hint is small piece of useful information that can help someone figure out a bigger question like if people hear you talk about kid math or hexagon enough they might use that information as hints or clues to figure out who you really are rex say oh yeah i suppose i was kinda doing that but right now we must get to work on a plan to stop dr twobrains from launching his phase two becky say i agree do you have any ideas rex say you bet i do why dont we just tear down the city before dr twobrains has a chance to turn it into cheese an image show the city in ruin a the hero hover over a defeated dr twobrains and his henchman the image fade a rex say great idea huh music plays becky say thats a horrible idea rex say horrible no its perfectly logical you see if we subtract the city from the equation then theres no city for dr twobrains to turn into cheese becky exclaims but we cant destroy the city rex float upside down and say sure we can we have amazing superpowers no one would be able to stop us becky say look rex theres more to this superhero thing than defeating villains the most important part of being a superhero is protecting the people get it rex say definitely he pause and exclaims oooh what if we turned the city into cheese first beating him at his own game becky sigh becky say i think its time for you to get to know some of the people were here to protect the scene change to inside the art classroom becky say rex this is my best friend violet violet this is my new friend rex violet stop painting and say hi rex if youre a friend of beckys and im a friend of beckys then we can be friends too what do you feel like painting today rex she hand rex her paintbrush he jump onto a stool and say i know ill perfectly reproduce my favourite equation in paint he excitedly wave the paintbrush and mark violet’s nose becky say reproduce means to copy or make something thats the same as the original rex furiously paint on the canvas a becky say so when you say perfectly reproduce your favourite equation do you mean youre going to actually paint a math equation on that canvas rex say that is correct he reveals his canvas and say look yellow plus blue equals green on the canvas are a yellow and blue block of paint next to a plus sign underneath is a green block of paint violet say wow thats really clever rex rex say thanks violet that was a nice compliment you gave me and compliments make earthlings feel good which i am an earthling not kid math im really bad at receiving compliments and not mentioning that im kid math becky slap a hand over his mouth and say yeah ive noticed rex say i really like your friend though shes a lot of fun to talk to in fact i like a lot of the kids ive met today becky say im glad dont you see these are the people that youre protecting and protecting them means protecting their city thats what makes a great superhero rex snap his finger and say yes a superhero finds a way to defeat the villain that also protects the people becky say now you get it exposition guy pop out from an open window and shout help dr twobrains has a giant ray aimed at the city from his mouse blimp wait is this the police station ms champlain the art teacher say no its a school the same as

uh you guys want to start the cheese ray amplification sequence right now henchman say oh right sorry boss cheese ray buzz dr twobrains say ah music to my mouse ears the henchman fly away carrying the cheese ray in one direction while dr twobrains escape in another dr twobrains continues it looks like you two have a choice either save the city from being turned into a giant hunk of mouthwatering cheese or capture me but you cant do both evil cackling the narrator say what will our heroes do will they stop dr two brains from escaping in his miniature mouse blimp and let the city be turned into cheese or will they shut down his cheese ray amplifier thing and let dr twobrains escape kid math say i choose both dr twobrains say you cant choose both listen up rookie by the time youre done shutting down the cheese ray ill be on a faraway beach sipping on a cheesea colada word girl say hes right there isnt time the people below look up and gasp kid math say but there is think about it  with math there are now two superheroes on the job so if we divide and conquer one of us can stop dr twobrains while the other one of us stops the cheese ray word girl say oh yeah great idea kid math you stop dr twobrains from escaping while i stop the rays from reaching the city kid math say id rather stop the rays if thats okay itll show that ive learned that a superhero must protect the people word girl stammer uh okay fine you got the rays i got twobrains go they bolt off in different direction dr twobrains say ahh word girl speed towards him and apprehends his minimouse blimp dr twobrains say why didnt i put a faster motor in the escape blimp dramatic music she bolt off the scene now show the henchman fighting kid math they aim their ray gun at him but miss after a moment they focus their attention to the ground the ray gun power up to fire kid math race towards the beam and destroys it the cheese ray shatters into a dozen piece and fall to the earth the crowd cheer below the henchman fall but kid math grab them a they fall kid math carry the villain to the mouse blimp to meet word girl and shout we did it word girl say yeah kid math say word girl plus kid math equals victory he throw the henchman into the jail blimp super huggy shriek kid math say right plus huggy sorry huggy forgot to carry the monkey the narrator say and so the addition of kid math to the team of word girl and huggy defeated dr twobrains and protected the wonderful people of the city the hero fly through the city a the people of the city cheer them from below narrator continues and it looks
